# Three.js Basic

This project demonstrates the use of essential features in Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics. The project includes examples of Orbit Controls, Stats Panel, and Dat GUI, which are fundamental for creating interactive and performance-optimized 3D scenes.

## Features

### 1. Orbit Controls
Orbit Controls allow the camera to orbit around a target object, providing an intuitive way to navigate the 3D scene. This feature is particularly useful for inspecting objects from different angles.

### 2. Stats Panel
The Stats Panel is a performance monitoring tool that displays the current frame rate (FPS) and rendering statistics. It helps in optimizing the performance of 3D applications by providing real-time feedback.

### 3. Dat GUI
Dat GUI is a lightweight graphical user interface used to control variables in JavaScript. In this project, it's used to tweak parameters in real-time, allowing for dynamic interaction with the 3D scene.
